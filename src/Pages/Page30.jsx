      <p>People poured into the streets. Children squealed. The river trickled. Trees swayed. Birds sang. 
         The hills turned green again. Flowers pushed through the soil like fireworks. Gardens that hadnâ€™t 
         bloomed in months now burst with colour. The air smelled like new beginnings as if the land itself 
         had been holding its breath for too long.

      <p>Thingo had awakened something in the town, magic that was thought to be gone.</p>
